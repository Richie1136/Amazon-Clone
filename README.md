# Amazon-Clone

Created Amazon-Clone using React, Axios for fetching the data from Firebase, used Stripe to process payments.

To run this project just clone this repo and then run npm i to install all of the dependecies that i have for this project and create a firebase project, and change the data inside of the firebase.js file and will need to create an account with stripe and change the test key inside of App.js
